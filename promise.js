// Asynchronous Concepts
// When it comes to development in Node.js and JavaScript, we use a mix of synchronous code (blocking I/O), and asynchronous code (non-blocking I/O). A common example of asynchronous code are Promises.

// Promises
// A Promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation. A Promise has three different outcomes: pending (the result is undefined and the expression is waiting for a result), fulfilled (the promise has been completed successfully and returned a value), and rejected (the promise did not successfully complete, the result is an error object).

// In the code below a new Promise is being defined and is passed a function that takes two arguments, a fulfilled condition, and a rejected condition. We then log the returned value of the Promise to the console and chain a .catch() method to handle errors.

// Creating a new Promise and saving it to the testLuck variable. Two arguments are being passed, one for when the promise resolves, and one for if the promise gets rejected.
const testLuck = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) { 
    resolve('Lucky winner!')
  } else {
    reject(new Error('Unlucky!'))
  }
});
 
testLuck.then(message => {
  console.log(message) // Log the resolved value of the Promise
}).catch(error => {
  console.error(error) // Log the rejected error of the Promise
});
